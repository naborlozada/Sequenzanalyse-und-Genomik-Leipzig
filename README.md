# Sequenzanalyse-und-Genomik-Leipzig-2018
Final results from the Bioinformatics course at University of Leipzig

"Inferring Horizontal Gene Transfer events"

Here you can find the results of HGT detection in the QUERY SEQUENCE. Two methods were used:
phylogenetic and parametric.

The two directories contain: 
  - PHYLOGENETIC: 
        * BLast hits BEFORE (500) and AFTER (290) the redundancy filtering (*.fasta).
        * Sequence alignment (*.phy)
        * Reconstructed phylogenetic tree (no bootstrap). Before and after its rename.
        * Reconstructed phylogenetic tree (100X bootstrap) Before and after its rename.
        
        


Data sequences were obtained from the public databases, here
