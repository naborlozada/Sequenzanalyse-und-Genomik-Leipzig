This directory contains two subdirectories with genes used as cases to detect HGT events:
  1)  Case 1 (only trees): Phylogenetic analysis of HGT in ribosomal genes (revisiting the Complexity Hypothesis).
              - Reconstructed of the best ML tree (simple DIR). All RAxML outputs and the renamed tree with the corresping gene taxa.
              - Reconstructed of the best ML tree and 100 boopstrapped ML trees (bootstraps DIR). All best ML tree and the bootstrapped
                tree. Three additional files: 1) labels for the leaves to rename the tree, (the corresping gene taxa), 
                                              2) the 'outtree' produced by Phylip (the consensus tree), and
                                              3) the renamed 'outtree' tree *.new_labels.tree
